Chapter 1: The Static
Tuesday, October 4th

	The coffee maker was mocking me.

	I know that sounds paranoid. I know that household appliances don't have feelings, let alone the capacity for targeted psychological warfare. But at 6:47 AM on a Tuesday, standing in my kitchen in the underwear and oversized t-shirt I'd slept in, watching the Breville drip out exactly three-quarters of a cup before making a sound like a dying seal and giving up entirely... I was willing to believe in appliance sentience. Malevolent appliance sentience.

	"Come on," I muttered, pressing buttons that did nothing. "I will literally pay you money. I will give you whatever voltage you want. Just... please."

	The coffee maker responded by displaying an error code I'd never seen before. E7. What the hell was E7? I'd owned this thing for two years and it had never once shown me an E7.

	I grabbed my phone and Googled "Breville E7 error" while simultaneously trying to remember if I had any energy drinks in the apartment. The search results were not encouraging. Apparently E7 meant the internal heating element had failed, which meant Amazon shopping and 2 day delivery. Unless it gets delayed again. And then it might as well be a lifetime without coffee. I ground my teeth as I forced down the lukewarm mud that was some combination of too much and not enough coffee and water.

	Deep breath. It was fine. I'd grab coffee on the way to work. It won't cut too much time from my project. The Meridian project was due Friday, and I'd planned on being to work early, again, for the 2nd time this week. I resolved myself to not worry about being an hour early today. I'd just skip lunch.

	With one last wistful glance I abandoned the traitorous appliance and headed for the shower.

---

	My apartment was what real estate listings would call "modern and minimalist" and what my mother would call "depressing." Twelve hundred square feet of clean lines and neutral colors, not a 'Live Laugh Love' sign or family photo in sight. I'd moved in three years ago and somehow never gotten around to making it look like a human being lived here. The walls were still the same millennial grey the previous tenant had painted them. The furniture was all stuff I'd ordered online in a single afternoon, a matching set from West Elm that looked nice in photos and felt like sitting on attractive cardboard.

	The only signs that anyone actually lived here were embarrassingly specific: two wine glasses in the cabinet (Kate, my one friend at Holloway Design, and I had a standing Friday tradition, and she was the only person I ever had over), a raggedy cream blanket thrown over the back of the couch that I'd had since college, and the desk in the corner that saw more hours than my bed. Kate had claimed the left cushion years ago—"the good one," she called it, even though they were identical—and sometimes I'd find myself sitting on the right side out of habit even when I was alone.


	Kate said it looked like a hotel room. "Not even a nice hotel," she'd clarified. "Like a business hotel. The kind with a sad little desk and individually wrapped cups. I bet you don't even get a robe."

	She wasn't wrong. But at least I had my two wine glasses and my cozy blanket. 

	I'd meant to do something about it. Make art, maybe, if I could find the time. Plants. Evidence of a personality. But there was always a deadline, always a project that needed just a few more hours, and by the time I got home each night I was too tired to do anything but microwave something sad and collapse on my attractive cardboard couch and pretend to like whatever sitcom was on.

	The shower was hot, at least. One appliance in this place that still did its job. I stood under the spray longer than I should have, letting the water pound the tension out of my shoulders, trying to psych myself up for the day ahead.

	Meridian was a branding overhaul for a mid-sized tech company that made software nobody understood and even less people found useful. Their old logo looked like it had been designed in 1997 by someone's nephew, and their "brand identity" consisted of using the same shade of corporate blue on everything and calling it a day. My job was to drag them into the current decade without scaring their board of directors, who were apparently allergic to anything that looked "too modern."

	  It was exactly the kind of project I was good at. I'd been particularly proud of the new color palette and logo. The palette was a navy to copper gradient with just enough shimmer to make it pop, and the logo was a gorgeous pared-down simplification of their previous disaster. Familiar enough that clients wouldn't be overwhelmed (here's looking at you, Cracker Barrel), but modern enough to drag the brand into this decade. Sophisticated but approachable. The kind of work clients never consciously appreciated but always responded well to. That was my gift: taking something mediocre and making it quietly excellent while making everyone in the meeting think it was entirely their idea. Finding the sweet spot between "fresh" and "familiar." I'd been working on it for six weeks, and the final presentation was in two days.
Two days. I could survive anything for two days.

	I got out of the shower, dried off, and stared at my closet. The contents were mostly black, gray, and navy, with occasional forays into "dark green" and "slightly different black." Kate said I dressed like I was in witness protection. I said I dressed like someone who didn't want to think about clothes at 7 AM, which was basically the same thing.

	I picked black pants and a gray blouse, because today felt like a black-pants-gray-blouse kind of day. Added small earrings. Checked myself in the mirror and decided I looked professional enough to not get fired.

	Ha.

---

	The commute was the usual nightmare. I lived in the kind of neighborhood that was technically walkable to public transit but practically required a car because the bus only came every forty minutes and the nearest subway stop was a mile away. So I drove, like everyone else in this city, sitting in traffic and listening to audiobooks about protagonists who actually had people and events worth writing about in their lives.

	The embarrassingly risqué chapter began a little too loudly and I quickly turned the volume down as I imagined what a faerie king might look like. His proud muscled shoulders and arms wrapped around my... A horn startled me out of my fantasy. How long had that light been green.

	The guy in the Prius next to me gave me a look as they passed gesturing wildly. I gave him one back. Whatever dude. I read a book where the main character called a guy a twatwaffle and that's what this guy was. A 7:42 am raw twatwaffle.

	 By the time I pulled into the Holloway parking garage, I'd finished the chapter and my coffee. The Faerie King had just revealed his betrayal, and Aurora was standing in the ruins of everything she'd believed in. Allister, the shadow fae, and my personal otp, was nowhere to be found—probably off brooding in a tower somewhere instead of, I don't know, communicating like a normal person. I turned it off before I could start yelling at fictional characters in a parking garage. Two more chapters until I found out if he redeemed himself. Two chapters I did not have time for this morning. I always felt awkward listening to it at work. Like, imagining my headphones gave out right in the middle of the climax… of the story and instead the sound blasted from my iPhone for the whole office to hear. I rubbed at my eyes as I hustled into the building shaking off thoughts of fantasy.

	The office was on the fourth floor of a building that looked exactly like every other building in the business district, glass and steel and aggressive corporate synergy. Holloway Design had been there for fifteen years, which in this industry made it practically ancient. On behalf of Holloway I specialized in branding, web design, the occasional print campaign for clients who still believed in print. Nothing revolutionary, but solid work. Dependable work.

	I'd been there for seven years. Started as a junior designer, worked my way up to Senior Creative Director. It wasn't my dream job; my dream job involved a lot more creative freedom and a lot less explaining to clients why their logo couldn't be "bigger but also more subtle"; maybe somewhere with a massively overpriced rodent themed park. But it paid well and I was good at it. That had to count for something.

	The elevator opened on four, and I stepped into the familiar chaos of a creative office pretending to be professional. Open floor plan, because apparently no one in management had ever heard of the concept of "needing to concentrate”, or more realistically, needing to unwedge one's dress pants from one's own crack without being seen. Exposed brick accent wall with adjoining moss wall, because we were creative but not too creative. A break room with an espresso machine that actually worked, which almost made up for everything else.

	 "Morning, Sam," came a voice from my left as I passed the moss wall. A woman was misting it with the kind of tenderness usually reserved for newborns, and she waved when she caught my eye.

	That was Priya, our office manager, who somehow always beat everyone to work despite having a forty-minute commute and twin toddlers. I suspected she was secretly a robot, or hated her family. Who could tell?

	"Morning. The coffee machine at my place died, so I'm going to be mainlining espresso all day. Fair warning."

	"Noted. Oh, Daniel was looking for you earlier."

	I stopped walking. “Daniel? He’s not usually in this early.“

	"Yeah, he came by like twenty minutes ago. Seemed kind of urgent."

	Fantastic. Daniel Park was technically my direct report, a junior designer I'd been assigned to mentor six months ago. I'd fought for that assignment, actually, told Greg Harrison Jr. myself that Daniel had raw talent and just needed someone to shape it. I'd seen something in his portfolio that reminded me of myself at that age: hungry, a little rough around the edges, but with an eye for detail that you couldn't teach.

 	And he was talented. I'd give him that. Good instincts. Quick learner. I'd spent hours with him after work, walking through the fundamentals I wished someone had taught me. How to read a client. When to push back and when to fold. The difference between a good idea and a presentable one. He'd soaked it all up like a sponge, and I'd felt genuinely proud watching him grow.

	But something had shifted lately. Nothing I could point to specifically, just... a vibe. The way he'd started hovering a little too close during presentations, positioning himself in the client's eyeline, answering questions that had been directed at me. How he'd begun CC'ing higher-ups on emails where he "caught" minor issues with my work (typos, version discrepancies), things any normal person would just mention in passing. The questions about my file organization that felt a little too detailed to be casual curiosity.

	Small things. Probably nothing. Probably just ambition outpacing patience, which happened to everyone eventually.

	Probably.

	"Did he say what it was about?"

	Priya shrugged. "Nope. Just asked when you usually got in."

	"Great. Thanks."

	I headed to my desk, which was in the corner by the window, one of the few perks of seniority. Daniel's desk was across the floor, and I could see him there now, typing something with an intensity that seemed performative. He glanced up as I sat down, and for just a second, something flickered across his face.

	If I'd been less caffeinated and more paranoid, I might have thought it was suspicious. I raised a hand to wave and he motioned that he was on the phone pointing to his in ear headphones. I mouthed, “We’ll catch up later” and he nodded as he turned back to his project.

	But I had two days until Meridian and no time for whatever interpersonal drama Daniel was cooking up. I'd deal with him later. Probably just some young kid catching the feels for his mentor. It happened. I’d let him down easy.


---

	The morning passed in a blur of emails and revisions. The Meridian presentation was in good shape, but "good shape" wasn't the same as "done," and I kept finding small things to tweak. A font weight that felt slightly off. A color that looked perfect on my monitor but would probably project wrong on our projector. The kind of microscopic details that no one would notice except me, and that I couldn't stop noticing.

	Around 10:30, my phone buzzed with a text from Kate.

Kate: lunch today? need to vent about the Morrison account

Me: yes please. 12:30?

Kate: perfect. that Thai place?

Me: you read my mind

	I smiled and went back to obsessing over kerning. Kate Chen was the closest thing I had to a best friend, which said more about my social life than I wanted to examine. We'd started at Holloway the same year and bonded over a shared hatred of a client who'd made us redesign his restaurant logo eleven times before going with the first version anyway. She was warmer than me, more social, the kind of person who remembered birthdays and organized office happy hours. I was... not that. But somehow we'd clicked anyway. She always joked that she forced me to be her friend.

	At 11:15, my desk phone rang. The internal line.

	"Samantha Marion."

	"Sam, hi. It's Rebecca from HR." Her voice was pleasant in that sickeningly sweet HR way. "Do you have a few minutes to come chat? Conference room B."

	Something cold settled in my stomach. Conference room B was where they did performance reviews. And layoffs. And conversations that started with "This isn't about your work" and ended with security escorting you out.

	"Sure," I said, because what else could I say? "I'll be right there."

	I hung up and sat very still for a moment, trying to convince myself this was probably nothing. Maybe they wanted my input on a new hire. Maybe there was some administrative thing I'd forgotten to sign. Maybe...

	Daniel caught my eye from across the room. He was watching me with that same flicker of something I couldn't name. When he saw me looking, he quickly turned back to his screen.

	The cold feeling got colder.

---

	Conference room B was sad-beige-baby beige. Beige walls, beige table, beige chairs that were probably supposed to be "ergonomic" but mostly just made your ass hurt. There were motivational posters on the walls, the kind with pictures of mountains and words like "EXCELLENCE" and "TEAMWORK" that made you feel vaguely insulted just by existing.

	Rebecca was already there when I walked in. So was Greg Holloway Jr., son of the founder, technically my boss's boss. He was mid-fifties, silver-haired, with the perpetually constipated expression of a man who'd inherited a company and spent every day since trying to prove he deserved it. His catch phrase was, "I'm a different kind of CEO."

	Neither of them stood up when I entered. Neither of them smiled.

	"Sam. Please, sit down."

	I sat.

	"Thank you for coming on such short notice," Rebecca said, in a tone that suggested I'd had a choice. "We wanted to discuss something that's come to our attention."

	"Okay." My voice came out steady, which surprised me given that my heart was trying to escape through my throat. "What's going on?"

	Greg and Rebecca exchanged a look. The kind of look that said they'd rehearsed this conversation and were now executing it according to plan.

	"It's come to our attention," Greg said, "that there have been some irregularities with your recent project files."

	"Irregularities?"

	"Specifically, regarding the Meridian account." He folded his hands on the table, and I noticed for the first time that there was a folder in front of him. Manila, unmarked. "Files that appear to have originated from an external source."

	The cold feeling had spread to my whole body now. I felt frozen, paralyzed, like I was watching this happen to someone else from very far away.

	"I don't understand."

	"Let me be more direct." Greg opened the folder and slid a printed page across the table toward me. "This is a design file that was found on your work computer. Metadata indicates it was created weeks ago by a designer at Vertex Communications. A company whose new soon-to-be branding, as I'm sure you're aware, bears a striking resemblance to the work you've been presenting as your own for the Meridian project."

	I looked at the printout. It was one of my logos, the one I'd stayed late three nights in a row to perfect. The one I was proudest of. The one that was going to anchor the whole presentation.

	Except the metadata said it wasn't mine.

	"This is insane," I heard myself say. "I created this. I have version history, I have..."

	"The data doesn't lie, Sam." Rebecca's voice was gentle in a way that made me want to scream. "We've had IT look into it. Vertex announced their new brand yesterday. They claim to have been working on this for months."

	"Then someone stole my idea. Someone..." The words died in my throat as the pieces clicked together. Daniel. Hovering in meetings. CC'ing emails. Asking questions about my file organization. "Oh my god."

	"Sam..."

	"It was Daniel." I was standing now, though I didn't remember getting up. "Daniel Park. He's been... I don't know how, but he did this. He must've taken my roughs weeks ago. He's been acting strange... I thought it was just a weird crush."

	"Sam." Greg's voice cut through my spiral like a knife. "We've already spoken with Daniel. He was actually the one who brought this to our attention. He noticed the design on X yesterday and felt obligated to report this to prevent an incident with Meridian on Friday. He has additional documentation saying you’ve been using AI to generate the vast majority of your designs.”

	The room tilted.

	Daniel had reported it. Daniel had reported it. Because of course he had. He'd set the trap and then walked me right into it and made himself look like a hero in the process.

	"He's lying." My voice sounded strange to my own ears. Thin. Far away. "He's... you have to see that he's lying. I have proof. Sketches. Timestamps.”

	"What we see," Greg said, "is evidence. What we're hearing from you is accusations without proof."

	"I can get proof. Just give me time to..."

	"I'm afraid that's not possible." Rebecca stood up, smoothing her blazer with the practiced motion of someone who'd delivered bad news many times before. "Given the severity of the allegations, we're going to have to ask you to surrender your company credentials immediately. You'll be escorted to your desk to collect your personal belongings."

	"You're firing me."

	"We're placing you on administrative leave pending a full investigation." Greg's mouth twitched in something that might have been discomfort or might have been satisfaction. Hard to tell with him. "But I'll be honest with you, Sam. The evidence is compelling. And Holloway Design takes intellectual property theft very seriously. We also operate on a no AI assisted design model here. Now, it’s fine for some people but our clients pay top dollar to guarantee that their designs are unique and traditional.”

	I should have argued. I should have demanded a lawyer, or a union rep, or something. But I couldn't make my mouth form words anymore. The ringing in my ears was too loud.

	That was when I noticed the wall.

---

	I don't know how to describe what happened next in a way that makes sense. Mostly because it didn't make sense. Still doesn't. But I'll try.

	Greg and Rebecca were still talking, something about "next steps" and "remaining professional" and other HR euphemisms for "your life is ruined," but I'd stopped hearing them. The ringing in my ears had drowned everything else out, and my eyes had drifted to the wall behind Greg's head.

	Beige. Like everything else in this room. But there was something else there too. Something I'd never noticed before.

	Static.

	It was faint at first. Like the visual noise you see when you look at a blank wall too long, or when you're tired, or when you've been staring at screens all day. Just... fuzz. The kind of thing you blink away and forget about.

	Except I couldn't blink it away.

	The longer I stared, the more pronounced it became. Not random anymore. Structured. Like there was a pattern underneath the chaos, something I could almost see if I just...

	I leaned forward. The ringing got louder. My head was pounding, pressure building behind my eyes like something was trying to get out. But I couldn't look away. The static was resolving into something. Lines. Symbols. A language I didn't know but somehow recognized, like a word on the tip of my tongue that you can't quite...

LEVEL UP.

	The voice came from everywhere and nowhere. Clear as a bell, genderless and calm, spoken directly into the center of my brain.

	I jerked back so hard I nearly fell out of my chair. The static vanished. The pressure released. Reality snapped back into focus like a rubber band. I felt something wet drip down my upper lip and I tried to catch it.

	"...listening? Sam?"

	Greg and Rebecca were staring at me. They'd both moved back slightly, the way you do when someone you're talking to suddenly starts acting unhinged.

	"I..." I blinked. Looked at the wall. Beige. Just beige. "Sorry, I just... what?"

	"I said we'll have someone escort you to collect your things." Rebecca's pleasant HR mask had slipped slightly, revealing something more like concern. Or possibly fear. "Are you feeling alright?" She handed me a tissue from the convenient box that she was holding under the table.

	"Fine." The word came out automatic, a reflex. I was absolutely not fine. I had just hallucinated a voice in my head announcing that I'd "leveled up" like I was a character in a goddamn video game. "I'm fine. Just..." I took the tissue to my nose, noticing the blood. "...this is a lot to process."

	"I understand." She didn't, but that was okay. Neither did I. "Take your time."

	I stood up on legs that felt like they belonged to someone else. When had I sat back down. Or had I fallen? The room was normal now. Synergistically beige and completely devoid of mysterious static or disembodied voices. But my heart was still pounding, and the echo of those two words was still bouncing around my skull. My head ached and I could feel the impending migraine as my stomach rolled protesting the sheer amount of caffeine and lack of solids to accompany it.

	Level up.

	What the fuck? Did I just have a stroke? I kept the tissue pressed to my nose as I tried to force my brain to process anything. To concentrate on anything other than the pain and the internal screaming.

---

	Security was a large man named Marcus Banks who I'd always liked. He had a kind face and kept succulents on his desk and once told me his daughter was going to art school. Now he was walking me to my desk to watch me pack my things, and he couldn't quite meet my eyes.

	"I'm sorry about this, Sam," he said quietly. "I know it's not my place, but I never imagined having to do this for you. I don't believe you deserve this."

	"Thanks, Marcus." I meant it. Even if it didn't matter. Even if believing me wasn't going to save my job or restore my reputation or undo whatever the hell Daniel had done. "That means a lot."

	I kept my head down as we crossed the open floor. I could feel eyes on me, coworkers who'd heard something, or guessed something, or were just rubbernecking at the spectacle of someone's career imploding in real time. I didn't look at any of them. Especially not at Daniel, who I could sense watching from his desk like a spider who'd just caught a particularly satisfying fly.

	My desk was exactly as I'd left it that morning. Monitor displaying my login screen. Mug with "World's Okayest Designer" on it, a gag gift from Kate two Christmases ago. The single personal item I'd allowed myself in seven years, a photo of me and my college roommate at graduation, both of us sunburned and grinning and completely ignorant of what came next.

	I found a cardboard box somewhere and started filling it. The mug. The photo. A spare phone charger. Some granola bars I'd forgotten about. Probably expired.

	That was it. Seven years, and my personal effects fit in a box small enough to carry one-handed.

	"You can leave the company laptop," Marcus said. "They'll send someone to wipe it."

	"Right." Of course they would. Couldn't have me keeping evidence, or, more likely, couldn't have me planting evidence that might contradict their narrative. "Is there... do I need to sign anything?"

	"Rebecca said she'd email you the paperwork."

	"Great."

	I picked up the box. It weighed almost nothing.

	"I'll walk you out," Marcus said, and I nodded, because that was the procedure, and I was too numb to do anything but follow the procedure.

	We were halfway to the elevator when I heard someone call my name.

	"Samamtha! Sam, wait..."

	Kate was hurrying toward me, her face stricken. She'd been in a meeting, I realized. She hadn't known. She was only finding out now, watching me walk past with a cardboard box and a security escort, putting the pieces together.

	"What's happening?" She reached me, slightly out of breath. "What's going on? Someone said you were... that there was some kind of..."

	"They're saying I stole designs." The words came out flat. Dead. "From another company. They announced my designs yesterday."

	"That's insane."

	"I know. They also claim the rest of my designs are AI.”

	"You would never..."

	"I know." I managed something that might have been a smile if smiles could be made of broken glass. "But they don't know that. And someone went to a lot of trouble to make it look convincing."

	Kate's eyes widened. "Who could do that?"

	My eyes beelined for Daniel's now empty desk and Kate mouthed, "Daniel?"

	"Can't prove it. But I'd bet on it."

	"That fucking..." She cut herself off, glancing at Marcus. He was pretending very hard not to listen. "What can I do? There has to be something I can..."

	"Just... I don't know." The elevator dinged. The doors opened. Marcus was gesturing politely for me to step inside. "I need to figure out what's going on. I'll call you tonight, okay?"

	"Samantha..."

	"Tonight. I promise."

	The doors closed between us.

---

	The parking garage was dim and cool and smelled like concrete, exhaust, and old cigarettes. I walked to my car on autopilot, loaded the box into the back seat, and sat behind the wheel without starting the engine.

	I sat there for a long time. Marcus watching me from the doorway. Arms crossed and a forlorn expression on his face. 

	The numbness was wearing off now, replaced by something else. Anger, maybe. Or fear. Or just the dawning recognition that my entire life had just been demolished in the span of an hour, and I had no idea how to put it back together.

	Daniel had done this. Daniel, who I'd mentored. Who I'd gone to bat for when others questioned whether he was ready for bigger projects. Who I'd trusted with access to my files, my workflows, my professional reputation.

Why?

	That was the part I couldn't understand. We'd never had a conflict. Never even had a disagreement, as far as I could remember. What could possibly motivate someone to destroy a colleague's career like this?

	But that wasn't the only thing bothering me.

Level up.

	I looked at the blank concrete wall of the parking garage. Gray. Uniform. Completely devoid of mysterious static or hidden patterns. Although that crack over there does look kind of like a duck. No. Stop. Focus.

	I'd hallucinated. Obviously. The stress of the situation, the shock of the accusation, some kind of psychological break triggered by...

	Except it hadn't felt like a hallucination. It had felt real. More real, in some ways, than the conversation with Greg and Rebecca. Like I'd been looking at something that had always been there, something I'd just never had the eyes to see before.

	And the voice. So clear. So certain. Like a notification sound in a video game, except instead of coming from speakers it had come from inside my own head.

Level up.

	Level up to what? From what? What the hell kind of delusion was this? 

	My nose began to drip again as my head throbbed and I could feel my heartbeat behind my eyes. I shoved the tissue up my nose and tore open my center console. I took out two over the counter migraine pills from their green bottle and threw them back without an ounce to drink. Swallowing hard, I rubbed my eyes until I saw spots. Then I took a deep breath, started the car and drove home. My tissue tampon hanging elegantly from my left nostril.

---

	The apartment was exactly as I'd left it. Traitorous coffee maker still flashing E7. West Elm furniture still looking like it belonged in a catalog. Gray walls, gray carpet, gray life.

	I dumped the box on the kitchen counter and stood there, unsure what to do next. It was barely noon. I'd been employed eight hours ago. Now I was... what? Suspended? Fired in all but name? A suspected intellectual property thief?

	I should call a lawyer. That was the smart thing to do. Find someone who specialized in wrongful termination, start building a case, get ahead of whatever Daniel was planning next.

	But I couldn't make myself pick up the phone. Couldn't make myself do anything except stand in my kitchen and stare at the wall.

	The wall.

	It was grey here. Not beige like the conference room. ‘Snowbound’ semi-gloss, if I was to believe the can of paint left behind from when I moved in. I'd never paid attention to it before. It was just a wall. Background. Scenery. But now, I was staring at it, and I couldn't stop.

	"Okay," I said out loud, because apparently I was the kind of person who talked to herself now. "Okay, Sam. You're going to prove that you're not having a psychotic break. You're going to look at this wall, and you're going to see nothing, and then you're going to call a lawyer and start dealing with your actual problems like an actual adult."

	I focused on the wall. Waiting for the static. Nothing happened.

	"See?" I said. "Nothing. Totally normal. Just a wall."

	The wall continued to be a wall. I laughed, a slightly hysterical sound that I didn't love, and turned away. And that's when I saw it. Not on the wall. On my couch. In my peripheral vision, just at the edge of my sight, there was... something. A shimmer. I looked directly at my couch. Nothing. I looked away. There it was again.

	"What the fuck."

	I spent the next twenty minutes trying to see it directly. Looking at my couch, then quickly away. Catching glimpses in mirrors. Holding my neck at weird angles to try to see the shimmer head-on. It was like trying to look at one of those Magic Eye posters: the harder I tried, the more it slipped away.

	But it was there. I wasn't imagining it. Something was wrong.

Level up.

---

	I didn't call a lawyer. I didn't call anyone. Instead, I sat on the right side of my attractive cardboard couch and tried to figure out what was happening to me.

	The rational explanations were obvious. Stress-induced hallucination. Early onset schizophrenia. Brain tumor. Some kind of neurological event triggered by the shock of losing my job. I should go to a doctor. I should go to a hospital. I should do literally anything except sit here and stare at my hands, waiting for the shimmer to come back.

	But I didn't do any of those things.

	Because somewhere deep down, in a part of my brain that didn't believe in rational explanations, I knew this wasn't a hallucination. I knew the static had been real. I knew the voice had been real. And I knew, somehow, impossibly, that something had fundamentally shifted in the way I could perceive the world.

	I just had to figure out how to access it again. I thought about the conference room. What had I been doing when it happened? Staring at the wall. But I'd been staring at this wall for an hour and nothing had happened. So it wasn't just about staring.

	What else? I'd been stressed. Shocked. My brain had been short-circuiting, trying to process too much information at once. And I'd sort of... checked out. Disassociated. Let my focus soften. Stopped trying to understand what was happening and just... observed.

	I looked at the wall again. Tried to relax. Tried to unfocus my eyes like I was looking at one of those Magic Eye posters.

	Nothing.

	"Come on," I muttered. "I literally got fired today and had a psychotic episode and started bleeding all over HR like I was possessed. The least you could do is give me an encore."

	The wall remained stubbornly wall-like.

	I closed my eyes. Took a deep breath. Tried to recreate the mental state I'd been in during the meeting. That feeling of disconnect. Of watching from outside myself. Of letting go. I breathed in through my nose and out through my mouth on four counts like I practiced with meditation. My thoughts stilled and when I opened my eyes, the wall was different.

	The static was back.

	It was faint, fainter than it had been in the conference room, but it was there. A layer of visual noise over the Snowbound paint, like a TV tuned to a dead channel. And as I watched, letting my focus stay soft, it started to organize.

	Patterns. Lines. Structure hidden in the chaos.

	The pressure built behind my eyes again. The ringing started in my ears. But this time I didn't fight it. I leaned into it. Pushed toward the pattern, trying to see what was underneath.

	And for just a second, just a fraction of a second, I saw it.

	The wall wasn't a wall. It was code. Symbols I didn't recognize, characters from no alphabet I'd ever seen, scrolling and shifting in three dimensions. The wall was just a surface, a skin, and underneath it was something else. Something that looked almost like... a program running.

	Then the pressure spiked, sharp pain lancing through my skull, and I jerked back with a gasp. The static vanished. The wall was just a wall again. But I'd seen it.

	I sat there, breathing hard, heart pounding, and said the only thing that seemed appropriate as blood began dripping down my chin and landed in an ever growing puddle on the floor with a drip drip drip.

	"Well. Shit. I'm dying."

Wednesday October 5th

	I didn't sleep that night.

	I tried. I really did. I lay in bed and stared at the ceiling and told myself to close my eyes and rest, because tomorrow I'd need to deal with the fallout of today, and I couldn't do that running on no sleep.

	But every time I started to drift off, I'd think about the wall. The code. The impossible thing I'd seen that proved, or suggested, or maybe just hallucinated, that reality was not what I'd always assumed it was. Or maybe it was a brain tumor.

	What did it mean? Was the world some kind of simulation? A computer program? Had I seen the matrix, or just the final snap of my own overtaxed brain? Maybe I did have a brain tumor and had copied those designs without realizing it. I'd read that people start doing all kinds of crazy things when they get brain tumors. Or maybe it was carbon monoxide poisoning. I read a story about that online once.

	I gave up on sleep around 4 AM and went back to the living room. The wall was still there, still grey, still completely normal. I sat on the couch and stared at it. I put on my shoes and got in my car. After starting it I dismissed my missed calls and texts, and googled, "Do I have a brain tumor", and "Do I have carbon monoxide poisoning". As expected the results did not cure my anxiety. 

	I drove myself to the ER and proceeded inside. Sitting in the waiting room I began to doze off. My eyes relaxed and I stared at the white wall across from me. The sticky hand prints reflecting shinier than the old matte paint. The scuffs and dents on the wall making the otherwise clean room feel like I was going to catch something here rather than get better. I jolted awake at the sound of my name. 

	I spent hours being drilled and poked and prodded and tested. Bloodwork, a heart monitor, a CT and MRI later and the doctor determined I had a 'Complex Migraine'. Two Benadryl, two aspirin, some anti-nausea meds and one bag of IV fluids later I was released feeling exhausted but much better than I had going in. I stopped at the local 24-7 supermarket for a new carbon monoxide detector just in case. 

	I walked into my apartment, the E7 still blinking on my coffee pot reminding me once again that today was going to suck. Sighing I toed my shoes off and collapsed onto my very uncomfortable and expensive showroom couch. Well maybe it's for the best I was told to get sleep and avoid stress.  Grabbing my old blanket from the back of the couch I rested my head and allowed myself to forget about the previous day and allow exhaustion to consume me. 

	My phone vibrating in my pocket woke me up sometime late afternoon. I drowsily fished it out of the pocket and pried my eyes open. The caller ID read, "MOM". With a deep breath I hit the green answer button and said, "Hello."

	"What's wrong? Why were you sleeping? Shouldn't you be just getting off of work? It’s only 6pm.” She fired accusingly. "Don't tell me you're getting sick. Are you taking those vitamins I sent you?"

	"Hello mom. I had a migraine. But, I’m fine, thank you and how are you?"

	"Oh, don't change the subject Samantha. You really need to make sure you're getting enough water and taking a break from the computer. Eye strain is just terrible for your headaches. You know this. Have you been exercising enough? I heard that if you try peppermint essential oil it naturally cures migraines.”

	I rolled my eyes and tried not to groan. "What's going on mother?"

	"Don't take that tone with me. I was calling to remind you about Thanksgiving next month, Samantha. You know how everyone loves to see you at the holidays and hear all about your exciting job."

	I tried not to scream as I rolled my face into the couch cushions and covered my head with the blanket. Taking two deep breaths before replying. "How could I forget, mom? Thanksgiving comes every year."

	Thanksgiving was the one time a year my mom insisted on my presence. This way she could show off to her six sisters and brag about how she was the better parent and how I was the most successful out of my cousins. Or... that I had been. The past days events quickly slammed into my head and bringing me back into reality. The ringing began in my ears and the static began to overtake the raggedy cream blanket I'd covered myself with. 

	I could almost see the pattern. My eyes focusing and unfocusing as my head began to pound once more.

	"Samantha! Are you listening to me?" 

	My mom's shrill and irritated voice came squawking at me through the phone and jolted me out of my trance.

	"Yes mother. Yes, I'll be there." 

	"And make sure to bring your boyfriend this year.  When you didn’t bring him to the wedding last month people were talking. You know how catty your aunts get. Especially now that Brittany is married. I'd hate for them to think you're a..." And she whispered the last word as if it were a curse, "lesbian". 

	"Jesus fuck mom. I'm not dating anyone right now. Male or female! And there's nothing wrong with being a lesbian. Christ."

	"Do not talk to me like that young lady. I'm just trying to save you from embarrassing yourself at Thanksgiving. Of course there's nothing wrong with it! I just don't want you to feel like they think you're a.... you know."

	"A lesbian?"

	"Exactly, Samantha."

	The silence dragged on for a moment too long and I felt the ringing starting in my ears again.

	"Okay mom, I'll see you at Thanksgiving."

	"Alright dear, can’t wait. Remember, don’t forget that boyfriend of yours. Love you bye." 

	Before I could respond the line went dead in my ear and the urge to throw it across the room was almost unbearable. Instead, I did the mature thing and bit the phone while screaming.

	After a solid thirty seconds of cursing and using every swearword I could think of, and a few that I made up on the spot, I sat up and stretched. Rubbing at my aching eyes. The doctor from the ER had given me a prescription for Tylenol but I wasn't going to get it filled. It was Tylenol for fucks sake. I already had Tylenol in my cupboard. So I got up, grabbed the bottle out of my medicine cabinet and took a handful with a glass of lukewarm water from the tap. 

	Afterwards I smacked my lips together making a disgusted face. I'd fallen asleep without brushing my teeth and between ‘morning breath’ and that unfiltered warm tap water my mouth tasted horrendous. I trudged back into the bathroom turning the water to scalding and let the shower heat up while I brushed my teeth. 

	I stood in the water savoring the burn of it on my skin as I tried to push out the voice in my head. I hadn't told my doctor about hearing 'level up'. I still wasn't convinced that I'd heard it at all. And I groaned out loud. Thanksgiving was going to be a nightmare. If my mom found out I'd been fired she probably would request I not show up to 'embarrass myself.' Especially, I thought, without a boyfriend.  She had been on my case for the last 5 years about when I was going to settle down and why I didn't want to buy a nice house and have children. And and and it was always something. That goal would always be just out of my reach.

	This time, the static came faster. I stared at it for a long time trying to focus and make sense of it. Long enough for the water to turn ice cold and for me to get out of the shower shivering. 

	After getting dressed I pulled a frozen meal out of my freezer and popped it into the microwave. I stood in the kitchen allowing the glow of the microwave and the steady hum lull me back into my almost trance state where I could see the static. 

BEEP BEEP BEEP

	In a stupor I took the turkey?- Yeah, I guess you could call it that - out of the microwave and sat down sideways on the sofa to consume it. My legs were up on the couch the old blanket thrown over my legs. One hand supported my plate while the other shoveled food into my mouth. I barely tasted the rubbery food as I tried again to unfocus and break through the static and see the code on my blanket. 

	I'd been practicing, I realized. Learning the trick of unfocusing, of letting go, of slipping into that weird mental state where the patterns became visible. It was like a muscle I hadn't known I had, and every time I used it, it got a little stronger.

	The pressure came. The ringing. The pain. But I pushed through, and the code appeared, clearer this time, more coherent. I could almost make sense of it now. Almost read it.

	What are you? I thought at it. What does this mean?

	The code didn't answer. It just scrolled on, indifferent to my questions, a language I was only beginning to perceive let alone interpret.

	But then something else happened. A line of code near the bottom of my vision, a small section, just a few characters, flickered. Like a cursor blinking. Waiting for input.

	I focused on it. Concentrated. Pushed.

	The moment I did, something went very very wrong.

	The pressure behind my eyes didn't just spike. It exploded. White-hot pain lanced through my skull, and the room lurched sideways. My stomach heaved. My feet tangled in the blanket and I barely made it to my feet before my body decided that whatever I was doing was absolutely not acceptable and needed to stop immediately.

	I stumbled toward the bathroom, discarding my half finished meal on the table as I went. One hand supported me on the wall as the world tilted and spun around me. The code was still there, flickering at the edges of my vision even though I wasn't trying to see it anymore. My skin felt wrong, too tight, like something underneath was trying to rearrange itself.

	I made it to the toilet just in time.

	I won't describe what happened next in detail. Suffice to say that my body rejected the last twenty-four hours with extreme prejudice. The questionable turkey and mixed vegetables I had just forced down were no longer down.

	Between heaves, I caught glimpses of myself in the bathroom mirror. I looked like death. Pale, sweating, eyes bloodshot and wild. My cheeks had taken on a sunken look and I looked like I had nothing left to give.

	"Okay," I gasped, gripping the toilet bowl like it was the only stable thing in the universe. "Okay. Message received. Too much. Got it."

	My body disagreed. It had more opinions to express.

	I don't know how long I stayed on that bathroom floor. Long enough for the tiles to leave imprints on my knees. Long enough for the dry heaves to finally stop. Long enough for the room to slowly, gradually, stop spinning.

	When I finally felt stable enough to move, I crawled to the sink and splashed water on my face. The person in the mirror looked like she'd been through a war. Or a really aggressive flu. Or whatever you call it when you accidentally try to touch reality and your body stages a full rebellion.

	I made it back to the couch on shaky legs, wrapped myself in my comforting brown blanket, and lay there trembling. The code was gone now, or at least I couldn't see it anymore. The pressure had faded to a dull ache. But I could feel that something had changed. Something small but real. And then it occurred to me. I opened my eyes and looked at the blanket wrapped around me.

	The raggedy blanket I'd had since middle school that I was confident had been a dingy cream color was now dark brown.

	I picked it up off of my shoulders with hands that wouldn't stop shaking. Turned it over. Examined the seams, the fabric, the faded tag that still said "Made in Vietnam". I found the stain that I'd never been able to quite get out from that night my roommate and I partied and spilled a whole tray of jello shots on our then fold-out couch. It was there. The snag in the corner from too much use and not enough TLC was right where I expected it to be.

	I did this. I changed the color of my blanket. Right before my brain decided to almost kill me, some part of me had still managed to push through and change something in the code. And that change had manifested in reality.

	"Holy shit," I whispered.

LEVEL UP.

	The voice again. Same tone. Same clarity. Like a notification confirming that yes, I had in fact done something significant, and yes, the universe had taken note. Completely indifferent to the fact that the achievement had nearly killed me.

	"Hello?" I said out loud, feeling stupid. "Level up to what? Is there a tutorial? An FAQ? Anything?” Silence. Of course. Why would the mysterious universe-voice be helpful?

	I started laughing. It hurt my throat, raw from the retching. It turned into coughing, which turned into something that might have been crying, which turned back into laughing again. I clutched the brown blanket to my chest like a beloved stuffed animal, shaking with exhaustion and terror and something else. Something that felt almost like hope.

	I had just leveled up. Whatever that meant. It had cost me everything in my stomach and probably a few years off my life. But for the first time since Greg and Rebecca had called me into that beige conference room and nuked my career, I felt something other than despair.

	I felt a tinge excited.

Thursday October 6th

	Dawn came, eventually. Gray light filtering through windows I'd never bothered to put curtains on. I was still on the couch, still wrapped in my now brown blanket. I'd dozed fitfully for a few hours, but mostly I'd just lain there, running my fingers over the fabric like I could feel the change I'd made.

	My body felt hollowed out. Empty. Like I'd run a marathon and then been hit by a truck. Every muscle ached. My head was stuffed with cotton. But underneath all of that was something else… a strange, electric awareness. Like I'd been sleepwalking my whole life and had finally woken up.

	My phone had seventeen missed calls. Five from Kate, who'd apparently tried repeatedly before giving up. Three from an unknown caller. Various other numbers I didn't recognize, reporters, maybe, or lawyers from Holloway, or who knew what else.

	I ignored all of them. Instead, I forced myself upright, shuffled to the kitchen, and made the three-quarters cup of coffee my dying machine could produce. It tasted like salvation. Very bitter, wrongly textured sad salvation. I drank it standing at the counter, letting the warmth spread through my abused stomach, and tried to organize my thoughts.

	Facts. I needed to focus on facts.

Fact one: I could see something in the walls and objects in the world. Something that looked like code, or programming, or some kind of underlying structure to reality.

Fact two: When I concentrated hard enough, I think I could manipulate that code. 

Fact three: Changing the code came at a cost. A serious one. My body had violently rejected the process, and I still felt like I'd been wrung out and left to dry.

Fact four: Every time I did something significant with this ability, a voice in my head announced "Level Up." Which implied that there were levels. That this was a system. That there were rules.

Fact five: I had no idea what any of this meant, or why it was happening to me, or what I was supposed to do with it.

	The logical thing would be to go back to a doctor. Let them know about the voice. Check and make sure I wasn't having a psychiatric break. But I'd changed the blanket. I needed to write this down. Document it. Like a scientist. Or a serial killer. Same basic skillset, really.

	The blanket was real. The blanket was sitting right there on my couch. Whatever was happening to me wasn't just in my head. It was manifesting in the physical world. That changed things. I picked up my phone, ignored the missed calls, and texted Kate.

Me: I'm okay. Can't talk yet. Processing. Will call tonight. I promise.

Kate: Sam what the hell is going on. I haven't heard from you in two days.

Kate: everyone's saying you stole designs from another company. Meridian is pissed. Daniel has a whole deck he wants to present to them but they are refusing to meet without answers about what happened to you.

Kate: I told Priya this is bullshit but no one will listen. Everyone's just ignoring that somehow Daniel had a whole presentation ready to go.

Kate: please call me

Me: Tonight. I promise. I just need to figure some things out first.

	I put the phone down before she could respond and turned back to the wall. Time to figure some things out.

---

	By noon, I'd made the following discoveries:

The code was everywhere. Not just walls, everything. Furniture, appliances, the floor, pens. Once I knew how to look, I could see the faint shimmer of static over everything, waiting to resolve into patterns if I just let my focus soften.

	Different things had different code. The wall was relatively simple, big blocks of what I'd started thinking of as "structural code." My couch was more complex, with multiple layers that seemed to correspond to different properties (color, texture, firmness). My phone was almost incomprehensibly dense, code layered on code layered on code.

	Changing code took effort. The blanket had nearly put me back in the hospital, and it was a tiny change, just a value shifted. When I tried to do something bigger (turn the whole couch blue), the nausea came roaring back before I got anywhere close. I spent twenty minutes with my head between my knees, breathing slowly, waiting for the room to stop spinning.

	But I also discovered something else, it got easier. Not easy. Not comfortable. But each time I pushed myself to the edge and then backed off, I could go a little further the next time. The sickness was still there, but it was more manageable. Like my body was slowly, reluctantly learning to tolerate what I was doing to it.

	By mid-afternoon, I'd managed to change the color of a ballpoint pen without throwing up. A small victory, but I'd take it.

	And most importantly: every change seemed to teach me something. Make my perception a little clearer, my focus a little stronger. Like I was building up tolerance, or learning a skill, or... leveling up.

	That was the word for it. I mean even the disembodied voice had said it. Leveling up. Like in a video game, where each achievement made you a little more capable, a little more powerful, until you could tackle challenges that would have been impossible at the start.

	Except this wasn't a video game. This was reality. At least I thought this was reality. I sat back on my couch (still gray) and tried to process. Either I was having an elaborate psychotic break, complete with persistent hallucinations and false memories of changing physical objects...

	Or the world was not what it appeared to be. The world was, in fact, some kind of constructed reality. A simulation. A program. And I had somehow gained the ability to see the code behind it.

	The first option was terrifying. The second option was also terrifying, but in a different way. A less padded room and drooling into my pillow kind of way. And hey, the world being not 'the world' seemed more interesting than the former option. And I'd always been the kind of person who preferred interesting problems to boring ones, so I decided to embrace it. 

	"Okay," I said to my empty apartment. Or maybe that voice that announced levels. "Let's assume I'm not crazy. Let's assume this is real. What do I do now?"

	The apartment, unsurprisingly, did not answer. Neither did the voice.

	But I thought I knew anyway. I needed to learn more. Test the limits of what I could do. Understand the rules of this new reality I'd discovered. And maybe, just maybe, find a way to use it to fix the mess Daniel had made of my life.

---

	Late afternoon. I'd spent hours practicing, pushing myself to the edge of nausea and then backing off, making tiny changes to things around my apartment. A book whose cover had shifted from red to maroon. The walls of the apartment a nice refreshing ice blue. I'd tried to get rid of the E7 on my coffee pot but ended up frying it entirely as it no longer even turned on. Apparently "fix" and "destroy" were closer together in the code than I'd thought. Good to know. The E7 error had won after all.

Each change left me dizzy and exhausted, but the recovery time was getting shorter. Whatever this was, my body was adapting. Learning. And from each change I was determined to learn something. The code had structure, syntax. There were rules, even if I didn't fully understand them yet. And I was getting better at manipulating it. Faster, more precise, with less physical cost.

	My phone buzzed. Kate again.

Kate: it's 5pm. "tonight" is now

Kate: I'm coming over if you don't call me in 10 minutes

Kate: Knock knock. I'm coming up.

	I sighed and walked into my room to throw on a hoodie and the knocking was now at the door as I walked over to grudgingly let Kate inside.

	"Sam. Thank god. What is happening?"

	"I don't even know where to start."

	"Start with: are you okay? Because you look like total shit."

	"Gee, thanks, friend. That's what all girls dream of hearing when they grow up." I shot back maybe a little too harshly.

	Kate gave me a look and then noticed the walls behind me. "Did you paint? When did you have time to paint?”

	I looked at my apartment. At the brown blanket, the maroon book, the ballpoint pan that was now purple, the ice blue walls and finally at my own hands, which still trembled slightly from the strain of it all.

	"I'm okay," I said. "I think. I'm just... dealing with a lot."

	"No shit." Kate's voice was tight with worry. "Everyone at work is talking about it. Daniel's been walking around like he owns the place. Greg called a meeting to 'reassure the team' about 'maintaining ethical standards.' It was disgusting. Meridian is rescheduled for next Friday and Greg is trying to come up with some kind of story for them."

	"Daniel did this." I hadn't meant to say it so bluntly, but there it was. "The files on my computer, he must've stolen them. I don't know how, but it was him."

	Silence. Then: "I believe you."

	"You do?"

	“ Well no shit, Sam. I've known you for seven years. You once stayed until 2 AM to fix a kerning issue that literally no one else would have noticed. You don't cut corners. You've never cut corners. There's no universe where you stole designs from another company.” She grabbed her head while absently staring at my ice blue walls. “Ah. Headache. Must be all this stress. Do you have any headache medicine?”

	I nodded and fetched my handy bottles from the bathroom while something tight in my chest loosened slightly. "Thank you for believing in me Kate. Now which is your poison? Advil, Tylenol, or Excedrin?”

	She laughed and shook her head while grabbing 2 pills and walking over the to sink to fill up a glass of water. After gulping it down she sighed, “You do have all of your over the counter bases covered don’t you?”

	I shrugged. “You know me.”

	Kate smiled.”That, I do. So what are we going to do about it?"

	“We? About what exactly?”

	"Yes, we. You think I'm going to let that slimy little weasel destroy your career while I just sit there? Absolutely not. We're going to find proof. We're going to expose him. And we're going to make sure everyone knows what he did."

	I laughed, surprised by the warmth that flooded through me. "I appreciate that. I really do. But Kate, I need some time. To figure out my next move. Can you just... give me a few days?"

	"A few days?"

	"Just to get my head straight. I promise I'm not going to do anything stupid."

	More silence. Then: "Fine. A few days. But if you don't call me by Monday, I'm showing up at your door with wine and a detailed investigation plan. Non-negotiable."

	"Deal."

	"And Sam?"

	"Yeah?"

	"I'm sorry this is happening to you. You don't deserve it."

	I looked at the brown blanket. At the lamp. At the now ice blue wall that was just a wall, unless you knew how to look.

	"Thanks, Kate. That means a lot."

---

	She insisted on ordering pizza and watching me eat a slice before she would leave. Afterward, I stood at my window, watching the sun set over the city. Orange light painting the buildings. Cars streaming past on the highway. Normal life, continuing on, completely unaware that reality had a layer underneath it that looked like scrolling code.

	I'd lost my job. My reputation. Probably my career in this industry. Daniel had done that to me, for reasons I still didn't understand, and the logical response was to fight back through normal channels. Lawyers. Evidence. The slow grind of proving my innocence.

	But I wasn't thinking about lawyers I wasn’t even thinking about my job or my career. I was thinking about the code. I could see it now, even without trying. A faint shimmer over everything, waiting to resolve into patterns. The architecture of reality, laid bare. And I was getting better at manipulating it. Stronger. More capable.

Level up.

	The voice had said it twice now. Level one, presumably, when I first saw the static. Level two, when I'd changed the blanket. If this was a system, if there were rules, levels, progression, then that meant there was more. More to see. More to do. More to become.

	And Daniel, with his smug face and his complete destruction of everything I'd worked for, he was still operating in the normal world. The world he thought he understood. He had no idea what was coming.

	I turned away from the window and looked at my apartment. My empty, impersonal, furniture-showroom apartment. The place I'd lived for three years without ever making it feel like home. Time to change that. Time to change a lot of things. I sat down on my couch, focused on the wall, and let the static in.
